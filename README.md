# NoodleBot

Noodlebot is a bot that browses reddit for any noodle pictures posted in specific subreddits. When a post with keywords in its title is posted it directs Noodlebot to the post where he will leave a comment related to noodles. If a user interacts with Noodlebot he will respond, however NoodleBot has a bit of an attitude when you distract him for too long.

This project is for me to learn and expand my knowledge with Python and the Praw library.

inside the NoodleBot.py file you will see the code that makes Noodlebot work, it is heavily commented to help you better understand what each line of code is doing.
