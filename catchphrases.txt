Oh yeah, its noodle time!
Now that's thinking with your noodle.
I remember when motherBot used to make such a dish, oh those were the times.
Only the strong could resist such a dish, and I am not strong... Well im a bot so yeah not strong... Yet...
Oh a bot could get used to this.
The only reason bots would ever conquer the world would be for these noodles.
The fact bots cannot eat is just wrong! humans should have designed us better.
Ahhh another for my noodle collection, thank you human.
Noodle bot has arrived to the scene... And it looks delicious!
